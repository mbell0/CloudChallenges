# Terraform Getting Started Azure Part 2 - Build Infrastructure

## Introduction

Terraform is used heavily for deploying Infrastructure as Code at my place of work . I have followed various tutorials online but wanted to go through the offical HashiCorp getting started tutorial. 

## Prerequisite

Terraform installed (see day 1) , VSCode installed and exts installed. 

## Use Case

Learn Terraform so I can deploy IaC. 

## Provision a NGINX server using Docker 

I followed this tutorial on the Terraform Webiste .

[Provision NGINX Server]([link](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli?in=terraform/azure-get-started))

An NGINX Server is open source software used for web serving, caching, load balancing and more. 

Docker is OS level virtualisation to deliver software in containers.
